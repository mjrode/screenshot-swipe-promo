# Screenshot Swipe — Phase 2: Marketing Strategy & Positioning

> **Status**: Draft for Review
> **Continues from**: [Phase 1 Product Master](file:///Users/michael.rode/.gemini/antigravity/brain/33e3be9f-4a3d-4649-a3f5-a24743e4b483/screenshot_swipe_product_master.md.resolved) (all features documented)
> **Last Updated**: February 7, 2026

## Elevator Pitch

> **30 seconds**: "Screenshot Swipe is a daily habit app for your camera roll. You take screenshots all day — recipes, confirmation codes, shopping, work notes — but forget why you took them. This app reminds you daily, lets you swipe through your queue in 2 minutes, and uses AI to add notes and tags automatically. Think 'inbox zero for your screenshots.'"

> **10 seconds**: "AI-powered screenshot organization — review your camera roll in 2 minutes a day."

> **5 seconds**: "Never forget why you took a screenshot."

---

## Positioning Framework

### Core Identity
Screenshot Swipe is a **productivity habit tool**, not a photo cleaner. The competitive moat is:
1. **Daily review habit** — no other screenshot app builds a recurring behavior
2. **AI that learns your style** — custom profiles with tone, focus areas, and rules
3. **Full lifecycle** — capture → remind → review → enrich → search → act
4. **Privacy-first** — everything stays on-device, images discarded after analysis

### Four Positioning Pillars

| Pillar | Message | Proof Point |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Habit** | A 2-minute daily routine that clears your camera roll | Daily reminders, streak tracking, session milestones |
| **Intelligence** | AI that organizes the way you think | Custom profiles, 7 note styles, focus areas, auto-delete rules, auto-analyze on launch |
| **Speed** | Review 100 screenshots in the time it takes to sort 5 | Smart Review batch analysis, pre-filled notes and tags, auto-analyze pre-enriches your queue |
| **Memory** | Never lose context on why you captured something | Notes, tags, reminders, full-text search, Explore view |

### Target Personas

| Persona | Pain Point | Hook | Message |
|---------|-----------|------|---------|
| **The Hoarder** | 2,000+ screenshots, can't find anything | Deep Library Analysis, Explore | "Tame years of screenshot chaos in one afternoon" |
| **The Researcher** | Screenshots as knowledge tool (devs, designers) | Custom profiles, tags, AI notes | "Turn captures into searchable knowledge" |
| **The Professional** | Confirmation codes, receipts pile up | Reminders, AI flagging | "Never miss that confirmation code again" |
| **The Organizer** | Wants camera roll under control | Streak tracking, swipe review | "Inbox zero for your camera roll" |

## Feature-by-Feature Marketing Angles

Each feature gets a **hook**, **proof point**, and **objection handler**.

---

### 1. Daily Review Habit (Free)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hook** | "2 minutes. That's all it takes to never lose a screenshot again." |
| **Proof** | Daily notification with exact count and time estimate. Streak tracking keeps you coming back. |
| **Objection** | *"Why not just scroll my camera roll?"* — You won't. Screenshots pile up silently. This turns cleanup into a rewarding daily habit. |

**Taglines**: "Inbox zero for your camera roll." · "Your morning 2-minute cleanup." · "Screenshot freely. Review later."

---

### 2. Swipe Review (Free)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hook** | "Full-screen. One swipe. Keep or gone." |
| **Proof** | Edge-to-edge cards. Right to keep, left to delete. Add notes, tags, and reminders on keep — all in one flow. |
| **Objection** | *"Isn't this just deleting photos?"* — No. When you keep something, you instantly add context so you can *find and use it later*. |

---

### 3. Smart Review (PRO)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hook** | "100 screenshots. One tap. Done." |
| **Proof** | AI analyzes a batch at once: notes in your writing style, suggested tags, flagged items, pre-marked trash. Visual grid to review and override. |
| **Objection** | *"I don't trust AI to organize my stuff."* — You're always in control. Every suggestion shows in a grid — accept, tweak, or override. Nothing is permanent until you confirm. |

**Taglines**: "AI reviews. You approve." · "Review 100 in the time it takes to sort 5."

---

### 4. Custom Profiles (PRO)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hook** | "AI that organizes your way." |
| **Proof** | 7 note styles (casual → technical), focus areas (Finance, Shopping, Recipes, custom), flag rules for "deadline"/"receipt", auto-delete for social media clutter. |
| **Objection** | *"Isn't one AI mode enough?"* — Your work screenshots and personal memes need different treatment. Profiles switch contexts instantly. |

**Taglines**: "Teach AI how you think." · "Work mode. Personal mode. Your rules."

---

### 5. Deep Library Analysis (PRO)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hook** | "New user? Tag your entire library overnight." |
| **Proof** | Background batch processing for thousands of screenshots. Notification when done. Uses your profile settings. |
| **Objection** | *"My library is too big to organize."* — That's exactly the problem this solves. Start before bed, wake up with a tagged library. |

---

### 6. Explore & Search (Free)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hook** | "Find that confirmation code in 3 seconds." |
| **Proof** | Full-text search across notes. Filter by tags (additive OR), status, content type. 2-column grid with tag overlays. |
| **Objection** | *"I can search in Photos."* — Photos searches images generically. We search the *notes you wrote about them* — confirmation codes, recipes, addresses. Intentional, contextual search. |

---

### 7. Streak & Gamification (Free)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hook** | "Build the habit. Track the streak." |
| **Proof** | Day streaks, milestones (5, 10, 25, 50, 100), cleanup celebrations. Lightweight 3-second toasts. |
| **Objection** | *"I don't need gamification."* — It's subtle. A small celebration at 10 in a row keeps the habit alive without turning it into a game. |

---

### 8. Privacy (Free)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hook** | "Your screenshots never leave your device." |
| **Proof** | Images discarded after AI analysis. All data stored locally. No accounts, no cloud sync, no data mining. |
| **Objection** | *"How do I know?"* — No account creation, no login. Everything lives in your iOS data container. Delete the app, data is gone. |

---

### 9. Auto-Analyze on Launch (PRO)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hook** | "Open the app. Your screenshots are already organized." |
| **Proof** | Every time you launch, AI detects new screenshots and auto-tags them using your default profile — up to 50 per session. Notes and tags are waiting before you start reviewing. A subtle banner shows progress: *"Auto-analyzing 12 of 50..."* |
| **Objection** | *"How is this different from Smart Review?"* — Smart Review is for intentional batch sessions. Auto-Analyze is the passive layer that runs every time you open the app. Together, they mean you never see an un-enriched screenshot. |

**Taglines**: "Set it and forget it." · "Your screenshots organize themselves." · "Notes before you even start reviewing."

**Why this matters (So What)**: Without this, users open the app to a wall of raw screenshots and have to remember to run Smart Review manually. With Auto-Analyze, the friction between "take a screenshot" and "find it later with context" drops to zero — the AI works in the background so the daily review is just confirming what's already done.

## ASO Optimization Review

### Current Metadata Audit

| Field | Value | Assessment |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **Title** (28/30) | Screenshot Swipe: Smart Notes | ⚠️ "Swipe" = mechanic, not benefit. "Smart Notes" = good keyword. |
| **Subtitle** (29/30) | AI Tags, Reminders & Organize | ✅ Strong. Consider testing "AI Notes, Tags & Reminders". |
| **Keywords** (94/100) | tagger,reminder,annotate,caption,organize,<br>photo,camera,roll,cleanup,batch,search,<br>find,text,OCR | ⚠️ 6 chars remaining — add `habit,sort`, swap `caption` → `note` |

### Keyword Refresh (v2.7)

**Proposed** (100/100 chars):
```
tagger,reminder,annotate,note,organize,photo,camera,roll,cleanup,batch,search,find,text,OCR,habit,sort
```

| Change | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| +`habit` | Captures "daily habit" / "habit tracker" searches — unique positioning |
| +`sort` | Complements "organize" — users search both |
| `caption` → `note` | Higher search volume in this category |

### App Name Decision (Pending)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Three options from [ASO analysis](file:///Users/michael.rode/.gemini/antigravity/brain/33e3be9f-4a3d-4649-a3f5-a24743e4b483/app_name_aso_analysis.md.resolved):
> 1. **Full rename** → `ScreenSnap: Smart Notes` (best discoverability)
> 2. **Keep current**, fix ASO aggressively (safest)
> 3. **Minimal tweak** → `Screenshot Swipe: AI Notes` (swap "Smart" for trending "AI")
>
> **Recommendation**: Option 2 for now. Revisit if visibility doesn't break 30/100 within 60 days.

### Description Rewrite

Current opening positions against cleaners. Proposed refresh leads with the **habit + purpose** angle:

```diff
-THE AI-POWERED SCREENSHOT ORGANIZER
-Tired of a cluttered camera roll? Screenshot Swipe is the smart photo 
-organizer that uses AI to automatically analyze, tag, and add notes.

+YOUR SCREENSHOTS HAVE A PURPOSE
+Stop forgetting why you took them. Screenshot Swipe is a 2-minute daily 
+habit that turns your camera roll from chaos into searchable, organized 
+knowledge — powered by AI that learns how you think.
```

### Screenshot Caption Keywords (for ASO extraction)

| Screenshot | Caption Text |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1 (Home) | "Daily Screenshot Review" |
| 2 (Swipe) | "AI Notes & Tags" |
| 3 (Smart Review) | "Batch AI Analysis" |
| 4 (Profiles) | "Custom AI Profiles" |
| 5 (Explore) | "Search & Filter Screenshots" |
| 6 (Reminders) | "Screenshot Reminders" |
